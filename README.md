CSC.exe is the CSharp compiler included in the.NET Framework and can be used to compile from the command prompt.

## Why use cmd instead of visual studio

Visual studio is paid while .net framework is free.

Since C# offer programmers to to run on a variety of Operating System platforms.

Although right now there is essentially just one C# compiler available from microsoft in future there will be other platform such as

UNIX, LINUX ,MACINTOSH thats why we use notepad and cmd for programming.
